What is a Hypergraph? What is Hypergraph Partitioning?
-----------
[Hypergraphs][HYPERGRAPHWIKI] are a generalization of graphs, where each (hyper)edge (also called net) can
connect more than two vertices. The *k*-way hypergraph partitioning problem is the generalization of the well-known [graph partitioning][GraphPartition] problem: partition the vertex set into *k* disjoint
blocks of bounded size (at most 1 + ε times the average block size), while minimizing an
objective function defined on the nets. 

The two most prominent objective functions are the cut-net and the connectivity (or λ − 1)
metrics. Cut-net is a straightforward generalization of the edge-cut objective in graph partitioning
(i.e., minimizing the sum of the weights of those nets that connect more than one block). The
connectivity metric additionally takes into account the actual number λ of blocks connected by a
net. By summing the (λ − 1)-values of all nets, one accurately models the total communication
volume of parallel sparse matrix-vector multiplication and once more gets a metric that reverts
to edge-cut for plain graphs.

What is KaHyPar?
-----------
KaHyPar is a multilevel hypergraph partitioning framework for optimizing the cut- and the
(λ − 1)-metric. It supports both *recursive bisection* and *direct k-way* partitioning.
As a multilevel algorithm, it consist of three phases: In the *coarsening phase*, the
hypergraph is coarsened to obtain a hierarchy of smaller hypergraphs. After applying an
*initial partitioning* algorithm to the smallest hypergraph in the second phase, coarsening is
undone and, at each level, a *local search* method is used to improve the partition induced by
the coarser level. KaHyPar instantiates the multilevel approach in its most extreme version,
removing only a single vertex in every level of the hierarchy.
By using this very fine grained *n*-level approach combined with strong local search heuristics,
it computes solutions of very high quality.
Its algorithms and detailed experimental results are presented in several [research publications][KAHYPARLIT].

#### Additional Features
 - Hypergraph Partitioning with Variable Block Weights:
 
 	KaHyPar has support for variable block weights. If command line option `--use-individual-part-weights=true` is used, the partitioner tries to partition the hypergraph such that each block Vx has a weight of at most Bx, where Bx can be specified for each block individually using the command line parameter `--part-weights= B1 B2 B3 ... Bk-1`. Since the framework does not yet support perfectly balanced partitioning, upper bounds need to be slightly larger than the total weight of all vertices of the hypergraph. Note that this feature is still experimental.

 - Evolutionary Framework (KaHyPar-E) (soon available, see pull request [#23](https://github.com/SebastianSchlag/kahypar/pull/23)):
   
   KaHyPar-E enhances KaHyPar with an evolutionary framework as described in our [GECCO'18 publication][GECCO'18]. Given a fairly large amount of running time, this memetic multilevel algorithm performs better than repeated executions of KaHyPar-MF/-CA, hMetis, and PaToH. The configuration [/config/km1_direct_kway_sea18.ini](/config/km1_direct_kway_sea18.ini) uses KaHyPar-CA to exploit the local solution space and was used in the [GECCO'18 experiments][GECCO'18bench]. The command line parameter `--time-limit=xxx` can be used to set the maximum running time (in seconds).
 
 - Hypergraph Partitioning with Fixed Vertices (soon)
   
#### Experimental Results
 We use the performance plots introduced in [ALENEX'16][ALENEX'16] to compare KaHyPar to other partitioning algorithms in terms of solution quality:
For each algorithm, these plots relate the smallest minimum cut of all algorithms to the
corresponding cut produced by the algorithm on a per-instance basis. For each algorithm,
these ratios are sorted in increasing order. The plots use a cube root scale for both axes
to reduce right skewness and show 1 − (best/algorithm) on the y-axis to highlight the
instances were each partitioner performs badly. A point close to one indicates that the
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/484403/36319808-6a679886-1344-11e8-86da-d69e53902a6b.png" alt="alt text" width="60%" height="60%" align="right">
partition produced by the corresponding algorithm was considerably worse than the partition
produced by the best algorithm. A value of zero therefore indicates that the corresponding
algorithm produced the best solution. Points above one correspond to infeasible solutions
that violated the balance constraint. Thus an algorithm is considered to outperform another
algorithm if its corresponding ratio values are below those of the other algorithm.


Performance plots and detailed per-instance results can be found on
the website accompanying each publication.

Requirements
-----------
The Karlsruhe Hypergraph Partitioning Framework requires:

 - A 64-bit operating system. Linux, Mac OS X and Windows are currently supported.
 - A modern, ![C++14](https://img.shields.io/badge/C++-14-blue.svg?style=flat)-ready compiler such as `g++` version 5.2 or higher or `clang` version 3.2 or higher.
 - The [cmake][cmake] build system.
 - The [Boost.Program_options][Boost.Program_options] library.


Building KaHyPar
-----------

1. Clone the repository including submodules: 

   ```git clone --depth=1 --recursive git@github.com:SebastianSchlag/kahypar.git```
2. Create a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Run cmake: `cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE`
4. Run make: `make`

Testing and Profiling
-----------

Tests are automatically executed while project is built. Additionally a `test` target is provided.
End-to-end integration tests can be started with: `make integration_tests`. Profiling can be enabled via cmake flag: `-DENABLE_PROFILE=ON`.  

Running KaHyPar
-----------

The binary is located at: `build/kahypar/application/`.

KaHyPar has several configuration parameters. For a list of all possible parameters please run: `./KaHyPar --help`.
We use the [hMetis format](http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/fetch/sw/hmetis/manual.pdf) for the input hypergraph file as well as the partition output file.
    
Currently we provide four different presets that correspond to the configurations used in the publications at
[ALENEX'16][ALENEX'16], [ALENEX'17][ALENEX'17], [SEA'17][SEA'17], [SEA'18](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03587), and [GECCO'18][GECCO'18].

A preliminary version our ALENEX'16 paper is available [here on arxiv][ALENEX16PAPER].

KaHyPar-MF integrates implementations of the BK and incremental breadth first search (IBFS) maximum flow algorithm into the framework (see [/external_tools/maximum_flow/](/external_tools/maximum_flow/)). The BK algorithm has been described in

  	"An Experimental Comparison of Min-Cut/Max-Flow Algorithms for Energy Minimization in Vision."
	    Yuri Boykov and Vladimir Kolmogorov.
	    In IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (PAMI), September 2004.
     
The IBFS algorithm **can be used for research purposes only** and is described in
